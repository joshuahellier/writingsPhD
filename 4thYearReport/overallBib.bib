  abstract={We consider an extension of the zero-range process to the case where the hop rate depends on the state of both departure and arrival sites. We recover the misanthrope and the target process as special cases for which the probability of the steady state factorizes over sites. We discuss conditions which lead to the condensation of particles and show that although two different hop rates can lead to the same steady state, they do so with sharply contrasting dynamics. The first case resembles the dynamics of the zero-range process, whereas the second case, in which the hop rate increases with the occupation number of both sites, is similar to instantaneous gelation models. This new ‘explosive’ condensation reveals surprisingly rich behaviour, in which the process of the condensate’s formation goes through a series of collisions between clusters of particles moving through the system at increasing speed. We perform a detailed numerical and analytical study of the dynamics of condensation: we find the speed of the moving clusters, their scattering amplitude, and their growth time. We finally show that the time to reach steady state decreases with the size of the system.}

abstract="The mean-field analysis technique is used to perform analysis of a system with a large number of components to determine the emergent deterministic behaviour and how this behaviour modifies when its parameters are perturbed. The computer science performance modelling and analysis community has found the mean-field method useful for modelling large-scale computer and communication networks. Applying mean-field analysis from the computer science perspective requires the following major steps: (1) describing how the agent populations evolve by means of a system of differential equations, (2) finding the emergent deterministic behaviour of the system by solving such differential equations, and (3) analysing properties of this behaviour. Depending on the system under analysis, performing these steps may become challenging. Often, modifications of the general idea are needed. In this tutorial we consider illustrating examples to discuss how the mean-field method is used in different application areas. Starting from the application of the classical technique, moving to cases where additional steps have to be used, such as systems with local communication. Finally, we illustrate the application of existing model checking analysis techniques.",
