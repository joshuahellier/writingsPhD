This is the skeleton of the thesis, in terms of the chapters etc planned. The Conclusions are still a little fluid, and the Results will consist of a large number of graphs, so I'll probably arrange that in a little more
detail when I get to it. Underneath the chapter headings I have put the percentage of completion, and where I have written stuff I have broken this down by section, subsection etc. As of now I have written just under half of the
Analytics chapter; I suspect that that chapter will constitute a little over a quarter of the finished thesis. According to my current estimates, I need a further 9 weeks to complete the thesis, which would imply
completion in mid-August. However, this might be an underestimate and is partially dependent upon obtaining decent 2d data soon, which might not happen as my calculations keep failing. Thus, I think an extension of one month
might be a good idea, just to make absolutely sure it's finished.
