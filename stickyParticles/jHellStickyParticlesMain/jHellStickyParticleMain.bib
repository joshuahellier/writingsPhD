  abstract={An extension of the totally asymmetric exclusion process, which incorporates a dynamically extending lattice, is explored. Although originally inspired as a model for filamentous fungal growth, here the dynamically extending exclusion process (DEEP) is studied in its own right as a nontrivial addition to the class of nonequilibrium exclusion process models. Here we discuss various mean-field approximation schemes and elucidate the steady state behaviour of the model and its associated phase diagram. Of particular note is that the dynamics of the extending lattice leads to a new region in the phase diagram in which a shock discontinuity in the density travels forward with a velocity that is lower than the velocity of the tip of the lattice. Thus in this region the shock recedes from both boundaries.}

  abstract={We consider an extension of the zero-range process to the case where the hop rate depends on the state of both departure and arrival sites. We recover the misanthrope and the target process as special cases for which the probability of the steady state factorizes over sites. We discuss conditions which lead to the condensation of particles and show that although two different hop rates can lead to the same steady state, they do so with sharply contrasting dynamics. The first case resembles the dynamics of the zero-range process, whereas the second case, in which the hop rate increases with the occupation number of both sites, is similar to instantaneous gelation models. This new ‘explosive’ condensation reveals surprisingly rich behaviour, in which the process of the condensate’s formation goes through a series of collisions between clusters of particles moving through the system at increasing speed. We perform a detailed numerical and analytical study of the dynamics of condensation: we find the speed of the moving clusters, their scattering amplitude, and their growth time. We finally show that the time to reach steady state decreases with the size of the system.}

  abstract={We consider the time evolution of an exactly solvable cellular automaton with random initial conditions both in the large-scale hydrodynamic limit and on the microscopic level. This model is a version of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with sublattice parallel update and thus may serve as a model for studying traffic jams in systems of self-driven particles. We study the emergence of shocks from the microscopic dynamics of the model. In particular, we introduce shock measures whose time evolution we can compute explicitly, both in the thermodynamic limit and for open boundaries where a boundary-induced phase transition driven by the motion of a shock occurs. The motion of the shock, which results from the collective dynamics of the exclusion particles, is a random walk with an internal degree of freedom that determines the jump direction. This type of hopping dynamics is reminiscent of some transport phenomena in biological systems.}

abstract="We investigate theoretically and via computer simulation the stationary nonequilibrium states of a stochastic lattice gas under the influence of a uniform external fieldE. The effect of the field is to bias jumps in the field direction and thus produce a current carrying steady state. Simulations on a periodic 30 {\texttimes} 30 square lattice with attractive nearest-neighbor interactions suggest a nonequilibrium phase transition from a disordered phase to an ordered one, similar to the para-to-ferromagnetic transition in equilibriumE=0. At low temperatures and largeE the system segregates into two phases with an interface oriented parallel to the field. The critical temperature is larger than the equilibrium Onsager value atE=0 and increases with the field. For repulsive interactions the usual equilibrium phase transition (ordering on sublattices) is suppressed. We report on conductivity, bulk diffusivity, structure function, etc. in the steady state over a wide range of temperature and electric field. We also present rigorous proofs of the Kubo formula for bulk diffusivity and electrical conductivity and show the positivity of the entropy production for a general class of stochastic lattice gases in a uniform electric field.",

volume="128",

pages="447--483",
abstract="We study the general properties of stochastic two-species models for predator-prey competition and coexistence with Lotka--Volterra type interactions defined on a d-dimensional lattice. Introducing spatial degrees of freedom and allowing for stochastic fluctuations generically invalidates the classical, deterministic mean-field picture. Already within mean-field theory, however, spatial constraints, modeling locally limited resources, lead to the emergence of a continuous active-to-absorbing state phase transition. Field-theoretic arguments, supported by Monte Carlo simulation results, indicate that this transition, which represents an extinction threshold for the predator population, is governed by the directed percolation universality class. In the active state, where predators and prey coexist, the classical center singularities with associated population cycles are replaced by either nodes or foci. In the vicinity of the stable nodes, the system is characterized by essentially stationary localized clusters of predators in a sea of prey. Near the stable foci, however, the stochastic lattice Lotka--Volterra system displays complex, correlated spatio-temporal patterns of competing activity fronts. Correspondingly, the population densities in our numerical simulations turn out to oscillate irregularly in time, with amplitudes that tend to zero in the thermodynamic limit. Yet in finite systems these oscillatory fluctuations are quite persistent, and their features are determined by the intrinsic interaction rates rather than the initial conditions. We emphasize the robustness of this scenario with respect to various model perturbations.",

Its role spans the spectrum, from a good pedagogical example to a universality class in critical phenomena. A quarter century ago, Katz, Lebowitz and Spohn found a similar treasure. By introducing a seemingly trivial modification to the Ising lattice gas, they took it into the vast realms of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. An abundant variety of unexpected behavior emerged and caught many of us by surprise.

abstract="The process of diffusion growth of a single crystal of plagioclase (consisting of two components: albite and anorthite) from a cooling magma melt is considered. Crystallization starts when the temperature becomes lower than the melting (liquidus) temperature and occurs as a result of the diffusion of melt components to the boundary of the growing crystal. The crystallization process is simulated by solving a system of nonlinear, linked by cross terms, nonstationary diffusion equations for albite, anorthite, and residual melt in the coordinate system moving with the growing crystal boundary. The dependence of the crystal growth rate on undercooling and temperature and of its composition on temperature and pressure is taken into account. Both quantities substantially depend on the component concentration ratio in the melt on the crystal-melt interface. The competition between the diffusion and crystal growth processes and the complex dependence of these processes on the current melt and crystal compositions and the system temperature lead to a strong nonlinearity of the problem. As a result of numerical simulation, it is established that with a linear decrease in temperature the growing crystal composition changes nonmonotonically. This makes it possible to propose a novel interpretation of the crystal zoning typical of natural magmatic systems.",

abstract="A Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating master equations with time-dependent transition rates is described. It is based on a waiting time image, and takes into account that the system can become frozen when the transition rates tend to zero fast enough in time. An analytical justification is provided. The algorithm reduces to the Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz one when the transition rates are constant. Since the exact evaluation of waiting times is rather involved in general, a simple and efficient iterative method for accurately calculating them is introduced. As an example, the algorithm is applied to a one-dimensional Ising system with Glauber dynamics. It is shown that it reproduces the exact analytical results, being more efficient than the direct implementation of the Metropolis algorithm",
