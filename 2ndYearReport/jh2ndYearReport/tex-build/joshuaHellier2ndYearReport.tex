\begin{abstract}
Corrosion is an important process, which may severely limit the utility of an alloy. In this PhD project, I am currently developing a simple 
model of the way Oxygen diffuses through pure Titanium, in an effort to capture the saliant features of this phenomenon. Once I am satisfied this model works, I wish to extend it to Titanium alloys
in order to explain why some of them are better at resisting corrosion than others.

\section{Introduction}

I apologise for the lateness of submission of this document; I was trying to get a little more research done before submitting it, and indeed I did derive some of the formulae about lattice gas equilibria
after the submission deadline. Throughout this report I will assume that the reader has already read my First Year Report, so I won't be rereferencing anything from that.
