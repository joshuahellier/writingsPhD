\chapter{Perliminary Work and Motivation}

Here we need to talk about the original intent of the project.

\section{The Ti$\text{O}_2$/Ti Interface System}

A description of the inital problem upon which the project was based.

\section{Molecular Dynamics}

\subsection{Initial Work Done with MD}
I used some LAMMPS code to try to work with MD initially.
\subsection{The Problems with MD}
Need to explain why issues with using MD, and why I eventually decided it was not a useful technique for this problem.

\section{Simple Large-Scale Models of the Ti/O/Nb Interacting System}
I had a think about various methods I could use to tackle the system in question, and decided that the approach would would be most likely to bear fruit would be a continuum-modelled bulk PDE system with appropriate boundary conditions between
phases.
\subsection{Proposed Linear System}
Simplest possible model, and why it failed.
\subsection{Attempts to create a Suitable Nonlinear System}
Talk about why nonlinearity is necessary, and the difficulties of parametrising it.
\subsection{Parametrisation from a Microscopic Model}
Talk about the Dresden conference and what I learned from it.
