\chapter{Abstract}

Interface growth, and in particular the prediction of its rate, has long been a tough problem in statistical physics. In this thesis, I will outline my personal take on the matter, and will showcase a possible approach to it consisting of
constructing a microscopic model on a lattice and using this to parametrise a large-scale model of the phenomenon. I will then discuss how to do this with multiple interacting particle species in play.
