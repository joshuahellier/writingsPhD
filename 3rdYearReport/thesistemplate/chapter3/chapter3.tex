\chapter{Multispecies Generalisation of the SPM}
Would like this to structurally mirror the previous chapter. Intend to use essentially the same methodology to analyse the generalisation as the original model, with a few tweaks here and there.
Of course, this is stuff I haven't done yet, so can't say with much more certainty than that!
