\chapter{The Sticky Particle Model}
Here we will talk about the SPM, which I have (mostly) written a paper about.


\section{Definition and Motivation}

\subsection{Interacting Diffusion through Lattices}
Here we describe why the assumptions of periodic potential + short-range interaction + hard core repulsion are reasonable assumptions for small particles moving through a metal lattice.
\subsection{Model Definition}
We put those assumptions together in 1D, and get the SPM.

\section{Analytic Derivations from the SPM}
This stuff is kinda self-explanatory.
\subsection{Continuum Limit MFT Derivation}
\subsection{Continuum Limit MFT Solutions}
\subsection{Continuum MFT Self-Downfall predictions}

\section{Numerical Calculations using the SPM}
\subsection{Code Setup Used}
\subsection{The Types of Calculation Performed}
\subsection{The Quantities Measured}
Or rather, the various quantities we could measure, and why we couldn't measure the other ones we wanted to measure.

\section{Numerical Results}
And their comparisons with related analytics. We should just chuck all the results we have in here. Inc. discussion about the spacetime flow patterns.

\section{Building a Full Continuum Model}
As in, tweaking the MFT to give correct bulk predictions, as well as boundary condition information, to get a recipe for prediciting large-scale stuff about the SPM.
