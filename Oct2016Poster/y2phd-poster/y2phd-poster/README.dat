          A0 Posters - Here are a few tips to help you to make an
          A0 poster using the colour printer in Rm3210 JCMB.
          Examples can be found on the 4th Floor opposite the
          "Powers of Ten" exhibition, where second year
          postgraduates exhibit their work.

          This information is really only of use to Staff &
          Research students since they are the only ones with
          access to the charge queue of the printer. I also accept
          no responsibility for you wasting money if you mess
          things up!

          Due to the many different machine architectures
          currently in use in the Physics Department some or all
          of the programs needed will be different versions to the
          ones I used. This may result in (drastic) changes to the
          final output. Have fun.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Get the following files:
        o README - an ASCII version of this document
        o poster.fig - the poster template
        o crest.eps - the Edinburgh University crest logo
        o greylogo.eps - the Edinburgh University crest (watermark)
        o example.eps - some example text
        o example.tex - source for the example text
        o figure.eps - an example figure
     These can be obtained by the above links (if using Netscape, you will
     probably need to right-click), or by anonymous ftp to
     landlord.ph.ed.ac.uk in the directory /pub/poster.

  2. Run xfig (version 3.1 or later) with poster.fig (xfig tip: if you find
     that the xfig button bar is a little too large for your display, try
     running xfig with the option -but_per_row 3). You should now see your
     template (if you are running xfig 3.1 you may see some "Unknown image
     type" errors - you can usually ignore these, but you will not be able
     to see the contents of your figures on the screen). Set the zoom level
     to 0.20 if you want to see the whole thing at the same time.

  3. Your first task will probably be to modify several preset parts of the
     poster:
        o poster title and authors (top left)
        o group (top right)
        o supervisor(s)/co-author(s) (bottom middle)
        o group colours - for second year posters, and many other occasions,
          you will want to use the group colours for the BORDER and the
          SECTION HEADINGS. These colours are:
             + applied optics (red)
             + condensed matter (green3)
             + fluid dynamics (blue - this is the default)
             + nuclear physics (gold)
             + particle physics (cyan3)
             + astronomy (magenta)

  4. You can now begin to build your poster by adding text and figures. The
     ABSTRACT is probably best entered using xfig's TEXT tool so as not to
     interfere with the watermark. The same goes for SECTION HEADINGS and
     FIGURE CAPTIONS which should be in the style shown.

          Important note concerning figures: at the time of writing,
          there is a problem with the A0 printer which means that
          filled objects created using xfig (squares, circles etc.)
          come out completely black. There is a workaround which you
          should use to avoid wasting money: do not use a solid fill,
          instead select a pattern and then use the same colour for pen
          and fill. The pattern will disappear as the foreground and
          background colours will be the same.

  5. For text, use the file example.tex as a template. If you wish, you can
     modify the \textwidth and \Large settings to amend column width and
     text size respectively. Note that text smaller than \Large should
     probably not be used. Once the section of text has been completed, you
     should LaTeX it as usual:

          latex example

     then use dvips with the following options to produce a bounded
     encapsulated postscript file:

          dvips -E example -o example.eps

     This can then be imported into xfig using the PICTURE OBJECT tool. Make
     sure you click the USE ORIG. SIZE button after reading the file in to
     ensure that the text is the right size. It is NOT a good idea to scale
     the text up or down with xfig - if you need text of a different size,
     edit the LaTeX file and generate a new encapsulated postscript file.

  6. To generate a postscript file of the whole poster, export it with:
        o magnification: 22.75% (use the fit to page button)
        o orientation: landscape
        o justification: centered
        o paper size: A4 (some versions of xfig may not have this option)
        o language: Postscript

  7. This postscript file can now be tested by sending it to your local A4
     postscript printer. For example:

          lpr poster.ps

     You can also use ghostview or ghostscript to preview your postscript
     file:

          ghostview poster.ps
          gs poster.ps

  8. When you are ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE that your poster is complete, and that
     it works on an A4 printer you can now send the postscript file (still
     with all the same options as listed above, in section 6) to the A0
     printer. To do this, you will probably need to copy your postscript
     file across to holyrood - if you find that there is not enough disk
     space available for you, then you should be able to put the file in the
     /tmp directory. Then, to start printing:

          holyrood% lpr -Pvc23 -Gx4u poster.ps

  9. Your poster should now be ready for collection from room 3210.

NOTE: PRINTOUTS FROM THE A0 PRINTER ARE *VERY* EXPENSIVE - 10 POUNDS EACH AT
THE TIME OF WRITING. DO EVERYTHING YOU POSSIBLY CAN TO BE SURE YOUR POSTER
IS CORRECT *BEFORE* SENDING IT TO THE A0 PRINTER.
