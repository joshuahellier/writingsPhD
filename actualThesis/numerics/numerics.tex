\section{Numerical Simulations of Continuous-Time Markov Processes}
\subsection{Known Methods}
Discuss commonly-used methods, and how they work. Eventually, talk about why we are using the n-fold way.
\subsection{\texttt{KMCLib}}
Talk about how it works, why I picked it over other implementations.
\subsection{Running \texttt{KMCLib} on \texttt{Eddie3}}
How calculations are managed day-to-day.
