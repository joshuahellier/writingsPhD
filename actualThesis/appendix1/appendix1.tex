\section{1d Ising Correlation Functions \label{sec:corrFnCode} }

The \texttt{Python} script at <location> computes the probability of a site being occupied $l$ lattice spacings away from an occupied site.
It requires the system size $L$ and the number of particles $N$ as inputs. The output is saved in a file called \texttt{corrFnResults.m}, which is formatted so that it may be used by \texttt{Mathematica}.



\section{$n$-Dimensional Continuum-Limit MFT \label{sec:mftCode}}

The Mathematica script contained in <location> computes the current which flows between two adjacent sites
(offset in the $e_1$ direction) in the MFT of the $n$-dimensional SPM; due to symmetry, this tells us
what happens in an arbitrary direction. In this case $n$ is set to $3$,
but it still works if changed to any positive number.
