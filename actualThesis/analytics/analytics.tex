\chapter{Analytical Results about the SPM}

\section{Existing Approaches to Nonequlibrium Statistical Mechanics}
\subsection{Mean-Field Theory}
Quick history of this, how to use it, when it might work.
\subsection{Exact Solutions}
Talk about stuff like ASEP. Remember to mention that only very specific models seem to be analytically solveable, in particular you can't have interactions and range in the current models.
\subsection{Where does the SPM stand?}
Basically, why we can't analytically solve it, and so why performing mean-field approximation is a decent start.

\section{Analytic Derivations from the SPM in 1D}
This stuff is kinda self-explanatory.
\subsection{Lattice MFT Derivation}
\subsection{Continuum Limit MFT Derivation}
\subsection{Negative Diffusion Coefficients}
When do they happen? What do they mean?
\subsection{Continuum Limit MFT Solutions}
There's a bunch of these.
\subsection{Continuum MFT Breakdown}

\section{The SPM in Higher Dimensions}
Kinda repeat the earlier stuff in higher dimensions, particularly 2 where we actually have data. Maybe less need for elaborate sections structure here; just write freely and see how it goes.
