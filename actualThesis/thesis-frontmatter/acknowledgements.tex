I would like to thank Giulio de Magistris, Alexander Slowman, Tom Ives, James Gratrex, Chay Patterson,
Pattanasak Teeratchanan, Yarden Brody, Andreas Hermann, Miguel Martinez-Canales, Eugene Gregoryanz,
Martin Evans,
Richard Blythe, Bartek Waclaw and anyone else I may have missed out for their helpful input during this research project. I also thank the ECDF team here at 
Edinburgh who have provided a great deal of material support and technical 
expertise to this project via
their ongoing upkeep of the computing infrastructure I made use of 
(primarily \texttt{Eddie3}); similarly, I must give many thanks to EPSRC for 
providing the funding which has made this project possible in the first place.

In addition, I am very
grateful to my parents and friends for their support during what has been a rather difficult time.
Most of all I would like to thank my supervisor, Graeme Ackland, who has contributed a lot of his time
and effort to produce the work you see before you today.
