I would like to thank Giulio de Magistris, Alexander Slowman, Tom Ives, James Gratrex, Chay Patterson,
Pattanasak Teeratchanan, Yarden Brody, Andreas Hermann, Miguel Martinez-Canales, Eugene Gregoryanz,
Martin Evans,
Richard Blythe, Bartek Waclaw and anyone else I may have missed out for their helpful input during this research project. I am also very
grateful to my parents and friends for their support during what has been a rather difficult time.
Most of all I would like to thank my supervisor, Graeme Ackland, who has contributed a lot of his time
and effort to produce the work you see before you today.
