+\subsubsection{Constant Speed Solution}
+According to Ivanova~\cite{ivanova2007}, we can have travelling solutions to our time-dependent MFT PDE. Introducing the variable $\omega = x - vt$, with $v\in \mathbb{R}$, our PDE solution $\rho(x, t) = \phi(\omega)$ obeys
+\begin{equation}
+ v \phi ' = -\frac{a^2}{\tau_0} \left[ 1-\zeta \phi \left(4-3\phi\right) \right] '
+\end{equation}
+with general solution found by solving
+\begin{equation}
+ \omega = \frac{a^2}{\tau_0 v} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \zeta \phi \left(8-6\mu-3\phi\right) - \left(1-\zeta\left[4-3\mu\right]\mu\right) \log{\left(\phi-\mu\right)} \right].
+\end{equation}
+Requiring that $\phi \rightarrow  1$ as $\omega \rightarrow 0$ and $\phi \rightarrow 0$ as $\omega \rightarrow \infty$, this reduces to
+\begin{equation}
+ \omega = \frac{a^2}{\tau_0 v} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \zeta \phi \left(8-3\phi\right) - \log{\left(\phi\right)} - \frac{5 \zeta}{2} \right],
+\end{equation}
+so at the leading edge of the wave, $\omega \rightarrow \infty$, $\phi \sim e^{-\frac{v \omega}{a^2}} $. At $\omega \rightarrow 0$ with $\phi \rightarrow 1$, which would physically represent the interface between the particle-saturated
+region and the non-saturated region, $\phi \sim 1 - \frac{v \omega}{a^2 \lambda}$. Note that the value of $v$ is not restricted by these equations, and a linear stability analysis of the leading edge does not imply speed selection like in
+the case of the Fisher wave\cite{sherratt1998transition}, so it seems like the speed of travelling wavefronts would be determined by the initial conditions; of course, we should expect the MFT to misbehave close to the interface,
+so the actual system would probably have some interface-based mechanism for choosing its wave-speed.
+\subsubsection{Self-Similar Diffusive Solution}
+Again using Ivanova's work~\cite{ivanova2007}, we see that there should be a self-similar solution in the same vein as the $\erf{x t^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ solution for the normal diffusion equation. If we now let $\omega = x t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, and
+again have $\rho(x, t) = \phi(\omega)$, this time $\phi$ must obey
+\begin{equation}
+ \omega \phi ' = -2\frac{a^2}{\tau_0}\left( \left[ 1-\zeta \phi (4 - 3 \phi) \right] \phi ' \right) ' .
+\end{equation}
+Of course, for $\zeta \neq 0$ this is nonlinear in $\phi '$, and therefore extremely unlikely to have closed-form solutions; however, this is something which we would like to properly explore in the future.
