To conclude, we have solved a nonlinear model for self-interacting sticky particles diffusing in 1D.  Although only the particles exhibit stickiness,  the analytics suggest a symmetry between vacancy-type and particle-type flow
at density of $\frac{2}{3}$, which is observed in the simulation.  The flow exhibits a foamy pattern with intermediate time-and-space correlations.  The continuum solution MFT is a good predictor of the bulk flow behavior of the SPM.
The negative diffusion constant found in MFT at high stickiness indicates  that the assumption of homogeneous density break down: thus the MFT predicts its own demise.
